Euler paths and Euler circuits :

An Euler path is a path that uses every edge of a graph exactly once.
An Euler circuit is a circuit that uses every edge of a graph exactly once.
An Euler path starts and ends at different vertices.
An Euler circuit starts and ends at the same vertex.

Condition: A connected multigraph or simple graph has a EULER CIRCUIT iff every vertex has an even degree.
           A connected multigraph or simple graph has a EULER PATH iff it has ONLY TWO vertices with odd degree.

A. to check if there is eulerian path or not.

public static void main (String[] args)
	 {
	 Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
	 int cases=scan.nextInt();
	 while(cases-->0)
	 {
	    int len=scan.nextInt();
	    int ar[][]=new int[len][len];

	    int odd=0;
	    for(int i=0; i<len; i++)
	    {
	         int count=0;
	         for(int j=0; j<len; j++)
	         {
	            ar[i][j]=scan.nextInt();
	            if(ar[i][j]==1)
	            count++;
	         }
	         if(count%2==1)
	         odd++;
	    }
	    
	    if(odd==2)
	    System.out.println(1);
	    else
	    System.out.println(0);
	 }
	 }
